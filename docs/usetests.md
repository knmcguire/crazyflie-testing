The tests in this repository is written using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/) framework and they are run against specific [sites](sites.md). A site is a collection of devices with specific properties and capabilities. The available sites are defined in the `sites/` folder.

In order to run tests against a site you need to set the `CRAZY_SITE` environment variable before invocing `pytest`:

```bash
$ CRAZY_SITE=single-cf pytest -s tests/QA/
```

Please note that the `CRAZY_SITE` variable should point out a **name** of a site, not the path or a filename.

## Where are the tests?

Right now we have a convention that tests that are to be run automagicly by sites, such as the [Crazylab](https://www.bitcraze.io/2021/08/the-beginnings-of-a-test-lab/), are found in the `tests/QA` folder. Tests that require flying or human intervention should not be put in the `QA` folder.

There are many ways to run pytest, to select or deselect, or make other configurations of how to run tests. For all of those we delegate to the [Pytest documenation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/usage.html).
