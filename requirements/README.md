<!-- This file is auto-generated! -->


The requirements represents what we can test about or products and devices. They are added to TOML files in this directory. The TOML files are parsed from the test framework and used as input to the tests. They are also rendered to markdown using `utils/render_requirements.py`.

Below is a list of the current groups:

- [bootloaders.md](bootloaders.md)
- [communication.md](communication.md)
- [decks.md](decks.md)
- [logging.md](logging.md)
